Pro Evolution Soccer 2016 (PES 16) is a video game developed by Konami and released in September 2015. It is the 15th installment in the Pro Evolution Soccer series and features Neymar as the cover star. The game aims to go back to the series' roots with enhanced gameplay, remastered Master League mode, realistic graphics and updated kits and boots.
 
The game received positive reviews from critics and fans, who praised its improved gameplay mechanics, fluid animations, realistic physics and dynamic weather effects. Some of the drawbacks of the game were its outdated rosters, lack of licenses for some teams and leagues, and poor online performance. The game was also criticized for its similarity to its predecessor, PES 15.
