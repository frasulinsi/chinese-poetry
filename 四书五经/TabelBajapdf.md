# TabelBajapdf: A Comprehensive Guide to Steel Profiles and Weights
 
If you are looking for a reliable source of information on steel profiles and weights, you may have come across the term "TabelBajapdf". This is a common name for a collection of PDF documents that contain tables of various steel shapes and their dimensions, sectional areas, unit weights, geometrical properties, and tolerances. These tables are based on the Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) for hot rolled steel sections.
 
TabelBajapdf can be very useful for engineers, architects, contractors, and anyone who needs to design, calculate, or estimate with steel structures. In this article, we will explain what TabelBajapdf is, where to find it, how to use it, and what are its advantages and limitations.

## What is TabelBajapdf?
 
TabelBajapdf is not a single document, but a series of PDF files that cover different types of steel profiles. The most common ones are:
 
- Tabel Baja Profil WF PDF: This file contains tables of wide flange shapes (WF), also known as H-beams or I-beams. These are the most widely used steel sections for beams, columns, and frames.
- Tabel Baja Profil Siku PDF: This file contains tables of equal and unequal angle shapes. These are often used for bracing, connections, and detailing.
- Tabel Baja Profil Kanal PDF: This file contains tables of channel shapes. These are similar to WF shapes but have flanges on only one side. They are often used for purlins, girts, and secondary framing.
- Tabel Baja Profil Hollow PDF: This file contains tables of hollow structural sections (HSS), also known as square or rectangular tubes. These are often used for columns, braces, and trusses.
- Tabel Baja Profil Pipa PDF: This file contains tables of circular hollow sections (CHS), also known as pipes. These are often used for columns, braces, and rails.
- Tabel Baja Profil Plat PDF: This file contains tables of flat plate shapes. These are often used for floor slabs, roof decks, and shear walls.

Each file has a similar format and structure. The first page shows the standard sectional dimensions and nominal weights of each shape. The following pages show the geometrical properties of each shape, such as the moment of inertia, radius of gyration, modulus of section, etc. The last page shows the dimensional tolerances according to JIS G 3192.
