## The Themes of Spirited Away
 
Spirited Away explores many themes that resonate with audiences of all ages and backgrounds. Some of the main themes are:

- **Identity and self-discovery**: Chihiro starts out as a spoiled and timid child who complains about everything and depends on her parents for everything. She gradually develops her own identity and confidence as she works hard, makes friends, and faces her problems. She also regains her true name, which symbolizes her sense of self.
- **Greed and corruption**: The film criticizes the negative effects of greed and corruption on society and nature. Yubaba represents the epitome of greed, as she exploits her workers and guests for money and power. She also steals people's names and memories to control them. No-Face represents the influence of greed on individuals, as he becomes corrupted by the bathhouse's environment and starts consuming everything in his path. The film also shows how greed can destroy nature, as seen in the case of the polluted river spirit that Chihiro cleans.
- **Respect and compassion**: The film celebrates the values of respect and compassion for others, especially those who are different or marginalized. Chihiro shows respect and compassion for the spirits she encounters, even when they are scary or rude. She helps them with their problems and earns their trust and friendship. She also shows respect and compassion for her parents, even when they are turned into pigs. The film suggests that respect and compassion are essential for harmony and peace in the world.
