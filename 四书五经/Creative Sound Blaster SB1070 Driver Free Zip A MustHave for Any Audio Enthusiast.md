If you encounter any problems with your sound card or its driver, you can try some troubleshooting steps.

You can do this by going to the Device Manager and looking for the Sound, video and game controllers category. Third, check if your sound settings are correct and that there is no conflict with other audio devices or applications. You can do this by going to the Sound Blaster Control Panel and adjusting the preferences and options.
