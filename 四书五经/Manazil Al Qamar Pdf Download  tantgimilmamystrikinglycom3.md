The lunar stations are a system of 28 asterisms or constellations that the moon passes through during its monthly cycle. Each station has a name, a symbol, a number, and a corresponding letter of the Arabic alphabet. The stations are also associated with various attributes, such as colors, elements, animals, plants, angels, and demons.
 
The lunar stations have been used for various purposes throughout history, such as determining the dates of religious festivals, predicting the weather, farming, navigation, medicine, and magic. The stations are also believed to influence the personality, destiny, and fortune of people born under them.
 
One of the most famous and influential books on the lunar stations is Shams al-Ma'arif (The Sun of Gnosis) by Ahmad al-Buni. Al-Buni was a 13th century scholar and mystic who wrote many works on magic and esoteric sciences. He was considered a master of the science of letters (ilm al-huruf), which is based on the belief that the letters of the Arabic alphabet have hidden meanings and powers.
 
In Shams al-Ma'arif, al-Buni explains the secrets and benefits of the lunar stations and how to use them for various purposes. He also provides diagrams and talismans for each station that can be used to attract or repel certain influences. Al-Buni's book has been widely circulated and translated in the Islamic world and beyond.
