## How to Use Altera Quartus 12.1 for FPGA Design
 
To use Altera Quartus 12.1 for FPGA design, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new project and select your target device.
2. Add your source files to the project. You can use different design entry methods, such as schematic editor, HDL editor, or IP catalog.
3. Analyze and synthesize your design. This will check your syntax, optimize your logic, and map your design to the target device.
4. Simulate your design. This will allow you to verify the functionality and timing of your design using testbenches and waveforms.
5. Assign pin locations and other device settings. This will configure your device according to your board layout and specifications.
6. Generate a programming file. This will create a file that contains the configuration data for your device.
7. Program your device. This will transfer the programming file to your device using a USB cable or a JTAG programmer.

For more details on how to use Altera Quartus 12.1 for FPGA design, you can refer to the user guide[^2^] or the online training courses[^2^].
  
## Example: Blinking LED with Altera Quartus 12.1
 
In this example, we will show you how to use Altera Quartus 12.1 to design and program a simple blinking LED circuit using a Cyclone IV FPGA device. You will need the following hardware and software:

- A Cyclone IV FPGA development board with a USB cable and a JTAG programmer.
- A computer with Altera Quartus 12.1 Lite edition installed.
- A LED and a resistor connected to the FPGA pins.

The steps are as follows:

1. Create a new project in Altera Quartus 12.1 and select the Cyclone IV EP4CE6E22C8 device as your target.
2. Add a new Verilog HDL file to your project and name it blink.v. This file will contain the code for your blinking LED circuit.
3. Write the following code in blink.v:

 `module blink (
    input clk, // clock input
    output led // LED output
);

// parameter for the clock frequency
parameter FREQ = 50000000; // 50 MHz

// parameter for the blinking period
parameter PERIOD = 1000000; // 1 second

// counter variable
reg [31:0] cnt;

// assign the LED output to the MSB of the counter
assign led = cnt[31];

// always block to increment the counter
always @(posedge clk) begin
    // if the counter reaches the period value, reset it to zero
    if (cnt == PERIOD - 1) begin
        cnt <= 0;
    end
    // otherwise, increment it by one
    else begin
        cnt <= cnt + 1;
    end
end

endmodule`
1. Analyze and synthesize your design. This will check your syntax, optimize your logic, and map your design to the target device.
2. Assign pin locations and other device settings. You can use the Pin Planner tool or the Assignment Editor tool to do this. For this example, we will assign the clk input to pin R8 and the led output to pin L3. You can also set other settings, such as voltage levels and I/O standards.
3. Generate a programming file. This will create a file that contains the configuration data for your device.
4. Connect your FPGA board to your computer using the USB cable and the JTAG programmer. Make sure your board is powered on and recognized by your computer.
5. Program your device. You can use the Programmer tool or the JTAG Server tool to do this. Select your programming file and click Start to transfer it to your device.
6. Observe the LED on your board. It should blink at a rate of one second on and one second off.

Congratulations! You have successfully designed and programmed a blinking LED circuit using Altera Quartus 12.1.
