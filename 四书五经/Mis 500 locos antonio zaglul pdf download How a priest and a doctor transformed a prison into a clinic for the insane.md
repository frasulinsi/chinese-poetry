## Antonio Zaglul: A Versatile and Humanistic Doctor
 
Antonio Zaglul was not only a novelist, but also a psychiatrist, a journalist, a radio announcer, and a biographer. He was born in San Pedro de MacorÃ­s, Dominican Republic, on April 3, 1920, to a Lebanese father and a Cuban mother. He studied medicine at the University of Santo Domingo, where he graduated in 1947. He then went to Spain to specialize in psychiatry and endocrinology with renowned professors such as Juan JosÃ© LÃ³pez Ibor, Juan Antonio Vallejo NÃ¡jera, and Gregorio MaraÃ±Ã³n.
 
Zaglul returned to his country in 1950 and became the first director of the Manicomio Padre Billini, where he worked for ten years. He faced many challenges and difficulties in his job, such as the lack of resources, the overcrowding of patients, the interference of the Trujillo dictatorship, and the stigma of mental illness. He tried to improve the situation of the asylum and its inmates by applying modern treatments, organizing cultural activities, promoting human rights, and denouncing abuses.
 
Zaglul was also a passionate writer who published several books based on his experiences as a doctor and as a citizen. His most famous work is Mis 500 locos, a novel that portrays the life of the asylum and its characters with humor and compassion. He also wrote Apuntes, En las tinieblas de la locura, Ciencia y humildad, and Despreciada en la vida y olvidada en la muerte, a biography of Evangelina RodrÃ­guez, the first female doctor in the Dominican Republic.
 
Zaglul was also involved in journalism and radio broadcasting. He wrote a weekly column for El Nacional newspaper for several years, where he expressed his opinions on various topics with his characteristic style and wit. He also worked as a radio announcer for HIIJ station in San Pedro de MacorÃ­s, where he started his career at the age of 20.
 
Zaglul died on May 10, 1999, at the age of 79. He left behind a legacy of dedication, creativity, and humanism that has inspired many generations of Dominicans. He is considered one of the most prominent figures of Dominican medicine and literature.
