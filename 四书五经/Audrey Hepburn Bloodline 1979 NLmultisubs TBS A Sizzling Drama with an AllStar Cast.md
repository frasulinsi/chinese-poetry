**Bloodline** is based on the best-selling novel by Sidney Sheldon, who also produced the film. It tells the story of Elizabeth Roffe (Hepburn), the heiress of a pharmaceutical empire, who becomes the target of a mysterious killer after her father's death. She has to deal with a board of greedy and ruthless relatives, who want to sell their shares of the company and make a fortune. She also falls in love with Rhys Williams (Ben Gazzara), the CEO of Roffe & Sons, who may or may not be involved in the murder plot.
 
The film was directed by Terence Young, who had previously worked with Hepburn on *Wait Until Dark* (1967), another suspenseful film. Young was also known for directing three James Bond films, including *Dr. No* (1962) and *From Russia with Love* (1963). The film features an impressive cast of international stars, such as James Mason, Irene Papas, Romy Schneider, Omar Sharif, and Gert FrÃ¶be.
 
**Bloodline** was Hepburn's only R-rated film in her career, and it was a controversial choice for her. The film contains scenes of violence, nudity, and sexual content, which were unusual for Hepburn's image. She later said that she regretted making the film, and that she only did it because she needed money to support her children. She also said that she felt uncomfortable with some of the scenes, especially the ones involving Gazzara.

The film was not well received by critics or audiences at the time of its release. It was criticized for its poor script, direction, editing, and acting. It was also a box office flop, earning only $8.2 million against a budget of $12 million. It is considered one of Hepburn's worst films, and one of the biggest failures of Sheldon's career.

The film has also become a cult classic among some collectors and enthusiasts of vintage cinema. The film is available on DVD and Blu-ray, with multiple language subtitles, including Dutch (NLmultisubs). The film is also known as **Sidney Sheldon's Bloodline**, to emphasize its source material.
