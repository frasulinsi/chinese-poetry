A Dark Eldar color scheme generator is a tool that allows you to experiment with different colors and combinations on a digital model. You can either choose from an existing model template or create your own from any model in the dakka gallery[^1^]. You can also use other online tools such as Coolors[^2^] or Color Hunt[^3^] to generate color palettes that match your desired mood and theme.
 
Here are some steps to follow when using a Dark Eldar color scheme generator:
 
1. Pick a model template or upload your own. You can find some examples of Dark Eldar models in the dakka gallery[^1^] or on Reddit[^4^]. You can also use any model that you like, as long as it has a clear outline and details.
2. Select the colors that you want to use. You can either use the default colors or customize them according to your preference. You can also use the color picker tool to select colors from an image or a website. Try to use colors that contrast well and create a sense of depth and dimension.
3. Apply the colors to the model. You can use the brush tool to paint over the areas that you want to color. You can also use the fill tool to fill in large areas with a single color. You can adjust the size and opacity of the brush and fill tools as needed.
4. Save and share your work. You can save your work as an image file or a URL link that you can share with others. You can also test your work by printing it out and comparing it with your actual model.

Here is an example of a Dark Eldar color scheme generated using the dakka model painter[^1^]:

You can see how the red, black, and white colors create a striking contrast and a sense of menace. The green accents add some variety and interest to the scheme.
